# United States Forest Service Online Permitting

### A collection of documents and links related to the 18F/TTS Forest Service ePermitting project

## Welcome!

The U.S. Forest Service is engaged in an ongoing effort to modernize and simplify their permitting processes. One facet of this effort is to make them available to obtain and purchase online. GSA's Technology Transformation Service's Office of Acquisitions is working with the Forest Service to plan and build out this platform.

## Opportunity Statement

#### The opportunity statement = the problem we are trying to solve with the ePermitting project

Existing administrative systems *restrict, rather than facilitate,* responsible use of the forest, and reduce the time spent on stewardship-oriented business and engaging Forest users. These processes and systems result in *sub-optimal customer satisfaction, less business, and less of a connection* between people and their environment. We believe that by *digitizing these processes for the public,* we will allow Forest Service staff to focus on their primary job, and help correct the current overemphasis on restriction rather than facilitation. And, we believe that this will lead to *better customer satisfaction and more permits.*
