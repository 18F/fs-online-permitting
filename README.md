### The focal point for 18F/TTS project with the United States Forest Service ePermitting project

## Welcome!

The U.S. Forest Service is engaged in an ongoing effort to modernize and simplify their permitting processes. One facet of this effort is “ePermitting”, or making the applications for many Forest Service permits available online.

## Opportunity Statement

#### The opportunity statement = the problem we are trying to solve with the ePermitting project

Existing administrative systems *restrict, rather than facilitate,* responsible use of the forest, and reduce the time spent on stewardship-oriented business and engaging Forest users. These processes and systems result in *sub-optimal customer satisfaction, less business, and less of a connection* between people and their environment. We believe that by *digitizing these processes for the public,* we will allow Forest Service staff to focus on their primary job, and help correct the current overemphasis on restriction rather than facilitation. And, we believe that this will lead to *better customer satisfaction and more permits.*
